# EPF Dividend Calculator
Just a simple calculator written in Python 3.10 for figuring out the amount of dividend you get after a year so you can check if everything is tallied. Specifically for EPF (Malaysia).

Current feature only includes a year with no fluctuations on salary, contribution rate (employee and employer) and no withdrawals. Will try and add them as the project develops.

Hope it helps!
